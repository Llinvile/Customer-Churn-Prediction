# Customer-Churn-Prediction
**Business-focused churn analysis combining machine learning, Tableau dashboards, and executive reporting to support data-driven retention decisions.**  

This project identifies early churn risk, explains *why* customers leave, and translates analytics into clear actions for financial and operational stakeholders.

✔ Predictive model with **91.8% ROC-AUC**  
✔ Two stakeholder-ready **Tableau dashboards** (exploratory + executive)  
✔ **PowerPoint business report** written for non-technical decision-makers

## 🎯 Business Objective
Customer churn directly impacts revenue stability and customer lifetime value.  
This analysis answers one core question:

**How can churn risk be identified early and translated into actionable business decisions?**

The dataset includes customer demographics, service usage, billing behaviour, and account history.

---

## 🔑 Key Business Insights

- **Declining usage is the strongest early churn signal** — customers disengage before cancelling  
- **Lower charges correlate with higher churn**, indicating weak perceived value  
- Churn risk can be detected **well before contract termination**, enabling proactive retention

## 📊 Executive Deliverables (Decision-Focused)

### 🔹 Churn Drivers Dashboard (Exploratory View)
Explains **why** customers churn by comparing usage and billing behaviour between churned and retained customers.

## 🧠 Technical Approach (Brief)

- Data cleaning and feature engineering  
- Class imbalance handling  
- Model comparison:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Random Forest
  - Gradient Boosting
  - XGBoost  

**Best model performance:**  
- **ROC-AUC: 0.9182 (91.82%)**

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- **Python**, Pandas, NumPy  
- **Scikit-learn**, XGBoost  
- **Matplotlib**, Seaborn  
- **Tableau**

## 🚀 Why This Project Stands Out

This project demonstrates how data science supports **real business decisions**, not just model performance:
- Analytics translated into **executive insight**
- Clear separation of **exploratory vs decision dashboards**
- Communication tailored to **non-technical stakeholders**

> _Designed to mirror how analytics is used in financial services and enterprise environments._
