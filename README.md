# Customer-Churn-Prediction
This project focuses on predicting customer churn for a telecommunications provider using machine learning techniques. The dataset was sourced from Kaggle and includes customer demographics, account details, and service usage patterns.

The goal is to identify customers at risk of leaving and provide insights that could help improve customer retention.

---
## 🎯 Objectives
- Build predictive models for customer churn classification.
- Perform extensive data preprocessing and feature engineering.
- Evaluate models with metrics suited for imbalanced datasets.

---
## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries
- Python, Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting)
- XGBoost

---

## 📊 Key Steps
1. Data cleaning and handling missing values.
2. Encoding categorical variables and feature scaling.
3. Training multiple ML models and comparing performance.
4. Evaluating with accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.
